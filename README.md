  - add label
  - request reviewers
  - post comment
- Workflow generator (1 template: Node CI) and commit to repo
- Basic web UI:
  - repo list
  - rules list + create rule
  - workflow “apply template” action
  - activity log (basic)

## Out of scope (MVP)
- Billing/Stripe
- Multi-tenant RBAC / team management
- Project V2 template syncing + health checks (stretch)
- Analytics dashboards (stretch)
- Drag-and-drop workflow editor (stretch)
- Environment secrets / deployments automation
  

## 🗺️ Project Roadmap — 11 Week Execution Plan

This project follows a disciplined 11-week roadmap designed to deliver a
demo-ready SaaS MVP suitable for a capstone presentation and long-term
extension.

### **Week 1 — Proposal, Planning, and Project Skeleton**
**Epic:** Capstone Planning

**Goals**
- Finalize project scope and proposal
- Begin development immediately

**Deliverables**
- Capstone proposal draft (problem, solution, scope, tech stack)
- Final MVP scope and explicit out-of-scope list
- GitHub repositories created:
  - `saas-web`
  - `saas-api`
- GitHub Project V2 board with Epics 1–7
- Backend skeleton:
  - Server setup
  - Environment configuration
  - Health check endpoint
- Frontend skeleton:
  - App shell
  - Routing
  - Authentication placeholder

**Milestone**
- Project builds, deploys, and is ready for feature development

## GitHub App Webhook URL (Temporary)

During initial setup, the GitHub App webhook URL is set to:

https://example.com/webhooks/github

This is a placeholder required to complete GitHub App creation.
The webhook URL will be updated to a real HTTPS endpoint
(ngrok or Cloudflare tunnel) once the backend API is running
and ready to receive events.

- Installation ID and repository metadata persisted

**Milestone**
- GitHub App installs successfully and backend receives real webhook events

---

### **Week 3 — Repository Discovery and Auth Flow**
**Epic:** Backend Infrastructure

**Goals**
- Surface GitHub data in the application
